UniShare is a program to automate our image exporting tasks.

The goal is to take photos that are already stored at unified.gallery export them to our cloud base
patient data management system Eyefinity.
Launching the program should be the only task left to the user.

UniShare uses the Selenium library for python.
All usernames, passwords, and patient test data are imported from a private file. So make ya own!
